  <p align="center">
    We need to complement current quantitative and qualitative approaches to designing more accessible web interfaces. This project utilizes 1) Gemini LLM to analyse a web interface based on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), provide usability insights and give recommendations, and 2) an eye tracker with a heatmap implementation to provide real-time qualitative feedback and gather deeper insights into user behavior.
